# Reporting Tool

I developed a reporting tool for a company I worked at as a project manager to make our Friday email updates smoother and more efficient. The tool is built using a tech stack that includes **React** for creating user interfaces, **Express** and **Firebase** for handling backend and database tasks, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. We also use **React Router Dom** for easy navigation and **TinyMCE** for a rich text editor, making it simple to write up detailed reports. This blend of technologies ensures that the tool is both robust and user-friendly, helping us compile and send our weekly updates with ease.

To make development and code quality top-notch, we rely on several dev dependencies. These include **Vite** for quick development and builds, **ESLint** to catch and fix code issues, and plugins like **@vitejs/plugin-react** and **@vitejs/plugin-vue** for smooth framework integration. **Autoprefixer** and **PostCSS** help with cross-browser compatibility and efficient CSS management. Using **TailwindCSS**, in particular, allows us to write clean, maintainable styles with utility-first CSS. These tools streamline the development process, making it easier to add new features and keep the tool running smoothly.

While the reporting tool has already made our weekly updates more efficient, there's always room for improvement if we get the time and budget. Future enhancements could include more customization options for report templates, advanced analytics for deeper insights, and automation features to further reduce manual effort. These additions would make the tool even more valuable, ensuring that our reporting process remains streamlined and effective.
